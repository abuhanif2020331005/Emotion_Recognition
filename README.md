# 😄 Emotion Recognition from Text

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that detects human emotions from textual input using a machine learning pipeline.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to classify text data into predefined emotional categories such as:
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Fearful
- Surprised
  

We built and evaluated multiple machine learning models using standard NLP preprocessing techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF / CountVectorizer
- Multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Emotion classification pipeline
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Ready for deployment (can be integrated with Flask/Streamlit)
